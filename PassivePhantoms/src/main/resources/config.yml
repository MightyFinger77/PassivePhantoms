# Behavior Information:
# - Phantoms start passive and won't target players
# - Phantoms become aggressive when hit by players or projectiles (arrows, tridents, etc.)
# - Once aggressive, phantoms will target and attack players normally
# - Custom spawn control prevents phantoms from spawning in the Overworld
# - Phantoms can spawn in The End based on the configured chance
